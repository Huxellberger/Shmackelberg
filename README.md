-- Running The Program

First you need to run 

./setuprmi

if not already done on this machine.

After you will need to run ./runclient for each experiment.

We have created unique scripts for running our leader optimally against each of the specific agents. These correspond to:

runsuprememk1 - MK1
runsuprememk2 - MK2
runsuprememk3 - MK3

These set parameters relate to window size/forgetting factor. 

It is important to **relaunch the client** after every run, otherwise the agent settings won't update.
